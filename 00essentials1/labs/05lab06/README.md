## Scenario
Take a look at the code in the editor: it reads a `float` value, puts it into a variable named `x`, and prints the value of a variable named `y`. Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:

3x3 - 2x2 + 3x - 1

The result should be assigned to `y`.

```
x =  # hardcode your test data here
x = float(x)
# write your code here
print("y =", y)
```

### Test Data

Sample input
```
x = 0
x = 1
x = -1
```

Expected Output
```
y = -1.0
y = 3.0
y = -9.0
```
