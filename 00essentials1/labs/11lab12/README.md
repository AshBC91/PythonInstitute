## Scenario

Your program must:

* ask the user to enter a word;
* use `user_word = user_word.upper()` to convert the word entered by the user to upper case.
* use conditional execution and the `continue` statement to "eat" the following vowels *A, E, I, O, U* from the inputted word;
* assign the uneaten letters to the `word_without_vowels` variable and print the variable to the screen.
